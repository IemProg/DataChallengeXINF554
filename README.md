# DataChallengeXINF554
A data challenge course work for INF554 "Machine/Deep Learning" Course

### Team (ID: Hawks):
    - Imad Eddine MAROUF
    - Anton EMELCHENKOV
    - Ali KESHAVARZI

- Packages requires: create a new conda environement using "Hawks_env.yml"

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
We provided a notebook, with insights about the dataset provided, most useful features 

### Features Selection/Generation:
- Notebook provided to see the correlation, the range, variance of each numerical feature extracted.
- Features Notebook: to generate more categorical, numerical features.

### Models:
- Logistic Regression: using only standard features
- XGBoost Regressor: using numerical features 
- DistilledBERT Model: Regression using distilledBERT model
- BERT with XGBoost: 
- NNsforRegression: Trying different neural network architecutre for regression.
- CarRegressor_XGBoost_NeuralNets: We ensembled all the three models, using the generated features (48 features) in order to improve the accuracy.
- LogisitcRegression_with_XGBoost: We ensembled all the two models.
